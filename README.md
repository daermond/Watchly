<br/>

**Watchly** is a Stremio catalog addon that fills your Stremio home with personalized movie and series recommendations built from your own watch history. It reads what you've watched, rated, and loved — from **Stremio, Trakt, Simkl, MDBList, or Nuvio** — builds a numerical taste profile from it, and serves a set of recommendation rows ("Top Picks for You", "Because you watched …", genre and keyword catalogs, and more) using metadata from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

Everything is configured through a web page; you paste the resulting manifest URL into Stremio once, and the catalogs keep refreshing in the background.

## Features

- **Personalized recommendations** — a taste profile (top genres, keywords, directors, cast, eras, countries, runtime) is built from your history and drives every catalog row.
- **Five history sources** — use your **Stremio** library, or your **Trakt**, **Simkl**, **MDBList** or **Nuvio** account. Ratings, watches, loves, and rewatches are all understood.
- **Multiple catalog types** — Top Picks, "Because you watched/loved", dynamic genre & keyword rows, recommendations from your recurring directors and actors, and "based on everything you loved/liked".
- **Fine-grained personalization** — discovery style (mainstream → hidden gems), release-year window, excluded genres (separately for movies and series), display language, and per-catalog enable/rename/shuffle controls.
- **Poster ratings overlay** — optionally overlay IMDb/TMDb-style ratings on posters via [RatingPosterDB](https://ratingposterdb.com/), Top Posters, or a custom template.
- **Bring your own keys** — supply your own TMDB, Simkl, or Gemini API keys, or rely on the server's.
- **Secure by design** — credentials are encrypted at rest in Redis and never appear in the manifest URL, which carries only a short opaque token.
- **Background sync** — catalogs are refreshed on a schedule so your home page is ready before you open it.
- **Fast** — aggressive Redis caching of profiles, libraries, and rendered catalogs keeps responses quick.

## How it works

1. You open the `/configure` page and connect a history source (Stremio login, Trakt/Simkl via OAuth, or an MDBList API key). Your credentials are encrypted and stored in Redis under a short opaque **token**. That token is embedded in your personal manifest URL.
2. Watchly fetches your watch history from the configured source and converts it into a source-agnostic library — ratings ≥ 9 count as *loved*, 7–8.9 as *liked*, the rest as *watched*.
3. From that library it builds a **taste profile**: a numerical fingerprint of your preferences across genres, keywords, people, eras, countries, and runtime.
4. When Stremio requests a catalog, Watchly routes the request to the matching recommendation engine, pulls candidates from TMDB (and Simkl where available), scores them against your profile, caps them for diversity, enriches them with metadata and (optionally) poster ratings, translates titles to your language, and returns a standard Stremio catalog.

Each user's state is keyed entirely on their token. You can switch history sources at any time; the library and profile are rebuilt from the new source.

## Catalogs

You choose which of these to enable on the configure page. Each can be toggled per content type (movies / series), renamed, hidden from the home page, or shuffled.

| Catalog | ID | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Top Picks for You** | `watchly.rec` | Your strongest personalized recommendations, combining profile-driven TMDB discovery with picks seeded from your library. |
| **Because you watched / loved** | `watchly.item` | Titles similar to one recent item. The seed is chosen at random from your 3 most-recent loved + 3 most-recent watched items; the row title becomes "Because you loved *X*" or "Because you watched *X*" accordingly. |
| **Genre & Keyword Catalogs** | `watchly.theme` | Dynamic, Netflix-style rows built from your favorite genres, keywords, and countries (e.g. "American Horror", "Based on a Novel"). Up to ~4 rows each for movies and series, varying with your history. |
| **From your favourite Creators** | `watchly.creators` | Recommendations from directors and lead actors who recur across multiple items in your library — not one-offs. |
| **Based on what you loved** | `watchly.all.loved` | Recommendations drawn from your entire set of loved items. |
| **Based on what you liked** | `watchly.liked.all` | Recommendations drawn from your entire set of liked items. |

## Watch history sources

Watchly works for users who keep their library in different places. Pick one source per install:

- **Stremio** — uses your Stremio library directly (requires a Stremio email/password or auth key).
- **Trakt** — connect via OAuth on the configure page; Watchly reads your watched history and ratings.
- **Simkl** — connect via OAuth on the configure page; Watchly reads your watched history and ratings.
- **MDBList** — paste your API key from [mdblist.com/preferences](https://mdblist.com/preferences/) on the configure page; Watchly reads your watched history and ratings. Needs no server-side setup.
- **Nuvio** — sign in to Nuvio on the configure page (the password goes from your browser to Nuvio, not to Watchly); Watchly reads the watched list of the profile you choose, one Watchly instance per profile if you want. Needs no server-side setup.

A single install uses exactly one source at a time. Switching sources rebuilds your library and profile from the new account.

## Personalization

All of these are set on the configure page and stored with your token:

- **Discovery style** — `mainstream`, `balanced`, `gems` (highly rated, less popular), or `all`. Controls the quality/popularity band candidates must fall in.
- **Release-year range** — restrict recommendations to a year window (default 1970–present).
- **Excluded genres** — hide genres you don't want, configured separately for movies and series.
- **Display language** — catalog titles and metadata are translated to your chosen language.
- **Sorting order** — show movies first, series first, or the default interleaving.
- **Poster ratings** — overlay ratings on posters via RPDB, Top Posters, or a custom URL template.
- **Per-catalog controls** — enable/disable, movie-only or series-only, hide from home, shuffle, and rename most catalogs.

## Installation (Docker)

Docker is the recommended way to self-host. Watchly requires a **Redis** instance; a server **TMDB API key** is optional but recommended.

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml`:**

   ```yaml
   services:
     redis:
       image: redis:7-alpine
       container_name: watchly-redis
       restart: unless-stopped
       volumes:
         - redis_data:/data

     watchly:
       image: ghcr.io/timilsinabimal/watchly:latest
       container_name: watchly
       restart: unless-stopped
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       env_file:
         - .env
       depends_on:
         - redis

   volumes:
     redis_data:
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file** (see the [configuration reference](#configuration-reference) for all options):

   ```env
   # Required
   TOKEN_SALT=generate_a_long_random_secret
   HOST_NAME=https://your-public-addon-url

   # Optional, recommended
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here

   # Redis (matches the compose service name)
   REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0

   # Optional — enable Trakt / Simkl (see "Optional integrations")
   # TRAKT_CLIENT_ID=
   # TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET=
   # SIMKL_CLIENT_ID=
   # SIMKL_CLIENT_SECRET=
   ```

   `HOST_NAME` must be the public URL where the addon is reachable. It is used to build OAuth callback URLs and the manifest URL, so it has to match what Stremio (and Trakt/Simkl) will see.

3. **Start it:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Configure and install:**
   Open `http://localhost:8000/configure` (or your `HOST_NAME`), connect a history source, pick your catalogs, and paste the generated manifest URL into Stremio.

### Unraid

A Community Applications-style template lives at [`unraid/watchly.xml`](unraid/watchly.xml).

1. Install **Redis** from Community Applications (any Redis container works).
2. On the **Docker** tab, click **Add Container**, switch to advanced view, and set the template URL to
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimilsinaBimal/Watchly/main/unraid/watchly.xml` — or add
   `https://github.com/TimilsinaBimal/Watchly` under *Template Repositories* and pick **Watchly** from the template list.
3. Fill in the required fields: TMDB API key, a long random token salt, the Redis URL from step 1
   (e.g. `redis://YOUR-UNRAID-IP:6379/0`), and the host name your Stremio clients will reach the addon on.
4. Start the container and open the WebUI to configure your catalogs.

## Choose a Redis

Watchly keeps every account, cache and rendered row in Redis, so it needs one it can reach on every request.

- **Docker: run Redis next to Watchly.** The `redis:7-alpine` service in the compose file above costs nothing, has no command or connection limits, and never gets deleted for being idle.
- **Vercel: use [Upstash](https://upstash.com/pricing/redis).** Its free plan fits a small instance, TLS is always on, and a free database that sits idle is archived and can be restored rather than deleted.

Roughly how much a user costs: serving a cached row takes about 3 commands (alias lookup, warm-up check, catalog read), so a home screen of ~10 rows plus the manifest is ~35. Each row is rebuilt once a day, about 10 more commands per row. A user who opens Stremio a few times a day comes to about 150–250 commands, or 5–8K a month.

| | Upstash free | Redis Cloud free (Deploy button) | Docker Redis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Commands | 500K / month (~60–100 users) | 100 ops/sec | no limit |
| Data | 256 MB | 30 MB | your disk |
| Connections | not published | 30 | no limit |
| TLS | always on (`rediss://`) | not available on free | local network |
| Idle database | archived after 30 days, restorable | deleted after 14 days without commands | never |
| Next step up | pay as you go, $0.20 per 100K commands | paid plans from $5 / month | — |

Sources: [Upstash pricing](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/pricing), [Upstash FAQ](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/help/faq), [Redis Cloud Essentials limits](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rc/subscriptions/view-essentials-subscription/essentials-plan-details/), [Redis Cloud TLS](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rc/security/database-security/tls-ssl/), [Redis pricing](https://redis.io/pricing/). Checked September 2026; confirm current limits before you pick.

Redis Cloud's free plan is the weaker fit on Vercel: each function instance opens up to `REDIS_MAX_CONNECTIONS` (20) connections, so two instances can exhaust its 30, and a home screen requests every row at once, which a few users together can push past 100 ops/sec. It is fine for trying Watchly out; switch to Upstash before you share the instance.

### Set up Upstash

1. In the [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com), create a Redis database. Pick the region nearest your Vercel functions; new Vercel projects run in `iad1` (Washington, D.C.), so AWS `us-east-1` is the usual choice.
2. Open the database's **Connect** section and copy the `rediss://default:<password>@<host>:<port>` URL from the redis-cli snippet. Don't use the REST URL and token (`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_*`, `KV_REST_API_*`): they are for Upstash's HTTP API, which Watchly's Redis client can't speak.
3. In Vercel, open **Settings → Environment Variables** and set `REDIS_URL` to that URL.
4. Redeploy from the **Deployments** tab.

The `rediss://` scheme turns on TLS, and redis-py handles it with no extra settings.

### Redis Cloud (Deploy button)

The Deploy button's **Redis** store creates a free Redis Cloud database and adds `REDIS_URL` to the project for you. On the free plan, set `REDIS_MAX_CONNECTIONS=10` so two instances stay under its 30-connection limit, and remember that the database is deleted after 14 days with no commands.

## Deploy on Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTimilsinaBimal%2FWatchly&project-name=watchly&repository-name=watchly&env=TOKEN_SALT,HOST_NAME&envDescription=A%20long%20random%20TOKEN_SALT%20and%20HOST_NAME%20set%20to%20https%3A%2F%2F%3Cproject-name%3E.vercel.app.%20TMDB_API_KEY%20is%20optional%20but%20recommended%3B%20add%20it%20later%20under%20Settings%20%3E%20Environment%20Variables.&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTimilsinaBimal%2FWatchly%23deploy-on-vercel&stores=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22redis%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22redis%22%7D%5D)

Vercel detects the FastAPI app with no extra config and runs it on Python 3.12, the version `pyproject.toml` and `.python-version` pin. A running instance also serves this guide at `/self-host`.

1. Click the button and pick a project name.
2. Accept the **Redis** store to try Watchly on a free Redis Cloud database; it adds `REDIS_URL` to the project. For an instance you'll keep, skip it and [set up Upstash](#set-up-upstash) instead (see [Choose a Redis](#choose-a-redis)).
3. Fill in `TOKEN_SALT` (for example `openssl rand -hex 32`) and `HOST_NAME` (`https://<project-name>.vercel.app`), then deploy. `TMDB_API_KEY` is optional but recommended: add it under **Settings → Environment Variables** (see [Configuration reference](#configuration-reference)).
4. If the production domain Vercel assigned differs from your `HOST_NAME`, fix it under **Settings → Environment Variables**.
5. Redeploy from the **Deployments** tab; environment variable changes only apply to new deployments.
6. Open `https://<your-domain>/configure` and set up your catalogs.

Leave `APP_ENV` unset: the `production` default refuses to start with the placeholder `TOKEN_SALT`.

**Limits.** Watchly finishes some work after it has answered a request, and Vercel's Python runtime has no way to keep the function alive for it, so that work may be paused or cut short:

- The setup warm-up may not finish. The configure page falls back to "Setup is taking a while", and the first home screen builds its rows as Stremio requests them, so it is slower.
- A stale row is served while it rebuilds in the background; if the rebuild is cut, the next request tries again.
- There is no scheduler: catalogs refresh only when Stremio requests them, and that refresh is not guaranteed to complete.
- A request can run for 5 minutes by default, so a very large library may time out on its first build.

If you want background refreshes to run reliably, use Docker.

## Configuration reference

All settings are environment variables. Only `TOKEN_SALT` and `HOST_NAME` are strictly required, plus a reachable Redis.

### Required

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | Optional, recommended. Each user enters their own TMDB key on the configure page; this server key is the fallback. Without it the configure page offers English only, and accounts saved before the page asked for a key have none to use. |
| `TOKEN_SALT` | Secret used to derive the encryption key for stored credentials. **Set a long random value** — the default `change-me` is insecure. |
| `HOST_NAME` | Public base URL of the addon (used for manifest and OAuth callback URLs). |

### Redis

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://redis:6379/0` | Redis connection URL. Redis is required. |
| `REDIS_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `20` | Max Redis connections per process. |
| `REDIS_CONNECTIONS_THRESHOLD` | `100` | Background Redis-heavy jobs back off above this many total clients. |
| `REDIS_TOKEN_KEY` | `watchly:token:` | Key prefix for stored user tokens. |

### Optional integrations

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TRAKT_CLIENT_ID` / `TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET` | — | Trakt OAuth app credentials; enable Trakt as a history source. |
| `SIMKL_CLIENT_ID` / `SIMKL_CLIENT_SECRET` | — | Simkl OAuth app credentials; enable Simkl as a history source. |

### Tuning & behavior

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `8000` | HTTP port. |
| `ADDON_ID` | `com.bimal.watchly` | Stremio addon ID in the manifest. |
| `ADDON_NAME` | `Watchly` | Display name in the manifest. |
| `APP_ENV` | `production` | `development`, `production`, or `vercel`. |
| `TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS` | `0` | Token expiry in seconds; `0` = never expire. |
| `AUTO_UPDATE_CATALOGS` | `true` | Refresh dynamic catalogs in the background on a schedule. |
| `CATALOG_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `86400` | Background refresh interval (24 h). |
| `CATALOG_CACHE_TTL` | `60` | `Cache-Control` max-age, in seconds, that Stremio may reuse a catalog response for. |
| `CATALOG_STALE_TTL` | `604800` | Soft-expiration fallback for cached catalogs (7 d). |
| `RECOMMENDATION_SOURCE_ITEMS_LIMIT` | `10` | Number of library items used to seed recommendations. |
| `LIBRARY_ITEMS_LIMIT` | `20` | Library item cap used in parts of the pipeline. |
| `ANNOUNCEMENT_HTML` | `""` | Optional HTML banner shown on the configure page. |
| `ALLOW_SIGNUPS` | `true` | Set to `false` to lock the instance to existing accounts; new signups are rejected. |

## Optional integrations

These are only needed if you want the corresponding feature; Watchly runs fine with just TMDB + Redis.

- **Trakt** — create an API app at [trakt.tv/oauth/applications](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications). Set the redirect URI to `HOST_NAME/auth/trakt/callback` and put the client ID/secret in `TRAKT_CLIENT_ID` / `TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- **Simkl** — create an AUTH V2 **Server apps & services** app at [simkl.com/settings/developer](https://simkl.com/settings/developer). Set the redirect URI to `HOST_NAME/auth/simkl/callback` and put the credentials in `SIMKL_CLIENT_ID` / `SIMKL_CLIENT_SECRET`. Use the HTTPS configure page in production. Watchly uses S256 PKCE, requests read-only access, and encrypts the saved refresh token so it can renew expiring access tokens.
- **AI-named rows** — users configure an LLM provider (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenRouter) with their own API key on the configure page; no server config required. Without one, rows fall back to deterministic names.
- **Poster ratings (RPDB)** — users enter their own [RatingPosterDB](https://ratingposterdb.com/) key on the configure page; no server config required.

## Development

Dependencies are managed with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv); a `requirements.txt` is kept in sync for non-uv environments. **Python 3.12+** is required, and a running Redis is needed for most functionality.

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/TimilsinaBimal/Watchly.git
cd Watchly

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the dev server (auto-reload)
uv run main.py --dev
# or
uvicorn app.core.app:app --reload
```

Create a `.env` with at least `TMDB_API_KEY`, `TOKEN_SALT`, `HOST_NAME`, and `REDIS_URL` before running. The configure UI is served at `/configure`.

### Tests, linting, formatting

```bash
# Tests (pytest is installed into the venv on demand)
PYTHONPATH=. uv run --with pytest pytest tests/
PYTHONPATH=. uv run --with pytest pytest tests/test_catalog_endpoint.py -v

# Lint / format (also enforced by pre-commit on commit)
pre-commit run --all-files
black .      # line length 120, py312
isort .      # black profile
flake8 .     # config in setup.cfg
```

## Architecture

Watchly is a FastAPI service that speaks the Stremio addon protocol. The request flow for every authenticated endpoint is:

1. **`app/services/context.py:load_user_context`** — decrypts the token, parses settings, resolves auth, and builds the `LibraryCollection` from the configured `watch_history_source`.
2. **`app/services/recommendation/catalog_service.py`** — routes the catalog ID to a recommendation engine (Top Picks, theme, item, creators, all-loved/liked).
3. The engine's results pass through metadata enrichment, poster-ratings overlay, translation, and serialization into a Stremio catalog.

The taste-profile pipeline lives in `app/services/profile/`, all external HTTP goes through `app/core/base_client.py:BaseClient` (retries, timeouts, structured errors), and Redis (`app/services/user_cache.py`, `app/services/redis_service.py`) is the source of truth for user state.
